# Frothly Store
Hi!  I'm Kate.  I'm using this great open source project from derkkila to build
a web store for my company, Frothly.  Please be careful if you use this as it
is still in development and it may have some bugs! 

## Now with CI/CD via Jenkins! 
Including some Github code scanning and output results to Splunk.
